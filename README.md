# MechaCar_Statistical_Analysis


## Linear Regression to Predict MPG

  ##  1.Which variables/coefficients provided a non-random amount of variance to the mpg values in the             dataset?
    
####•	(intercept)

####•	mechaCar_table$ground_clearance

####•	mechaCar_table$vehivle_length

 ##   2.Is the slope of the linear model considered to be zero? Why or why not?
    
   #### Does not especify to be 0 because the solpe of the linear model is represented by the variable in the model wich is vehicle_leng and ground_clearence and but ground clearence seems not to be 0
    
    
  ###  Does this linear model predict mpg of MechaCar prototypes effectively? Why or why not?
  
  #### Yes showed by R-squared value of 0.7149. The adjusted R-squared of 0.6825 shows to be a good fit to the data but not perfect.
